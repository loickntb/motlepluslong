# motlepluslong
This program is inspired from a french tv show (des chiffres et des lettres) , The goal is to form the longest word from 10 randomly drawn letters.

Ten letters are drawn, it's the draw. The program user must then form the longest possible word comprising some or all of the letters in the draw.
The program reads the word found by the user from the keyboard, it checks that the word is indeed composed of letters from the draw and displays the correspondence of the letters of the word and the draw.
It checks if the word is present in the dictionary. If both conditions are met, it displays the length of the word.
The letters do not contain accents, cedillas or umlauts. They are written in capital letters.
